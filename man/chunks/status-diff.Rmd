## Differences between `cli_status_*` and `cli_process_*`

For historical reasons cli has two sets of functions to manage the status
bar: the `cli_status*` functions and the `cli_process_*` functions.

Both sets are equivalent, but have different defaults:

* `cli_process_*` prints termination messages by default.
* `cli_process_*` by default styles the status messages, the same way as
   - `cli_alert_info()`, while the status is active,
   - `cli_alert_success()` for successful termination,
   - `cli_alert_danger()` for unsuccessful termination.

  If you want to style the `cli_status*()` status messages, you need to
  add classes manually, e.g.
  ```r
  cli_status(msg = "{.alert Starting computation}")
  ```
* `cli_process_*` omits the `... done` and `... failed` suffixes from the
  default termination messages, as the styling conveys this information.
